# Advent of Code Practice 2023

Welcome to my journey through the 2023 Advent of Code! This project is a personal endeavor to enhance my Python programming skills, undertaken with assistance from my intern, the AI language model GPT-4, developed by OpenAI.

## Approach

In this series of challenges, I'm incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for brainstorming and problem-solving. This includes using LLMs to:
- Tackle sub-problems.
- Explore example edge cases within daily challenges.

However, I am consciously avoiding the direct insertion of complete problem statements into the LLM. While these example problems may fit within a single context window, many real-world projects extend beyond this scope. The primary goal here is to sharpen my own abilities, focusing on the process rather than solely relying on the capabilities of GPT-4.

## Inputs

All inputs for the challenges are assumed to be saved locally in text files, such as "day1.txt". Please note that these input files will not be posted on this page.

## Disclaimer

While GPT-4 plays a role in guiding and providing suggestions, the core solutions and approaches are my own. This practice is about growing my skill set and understanding of Python in a practical, hands-on manner.

## Enjoyment

I invite you to follow my progress and insights as I navigate through the challenges. Your feedback and thoughts are most welcome!
